# a99 Final Project: HeelMeals

## Overview

Food is important to college students. That’s why we decided to create a dining hall meal review website for students at UNC.

Sometimes, the name of a dining hall dish isn’t enough to decide whether to indulge in it. Reading the opinions of peers, and seeing the meal itself, will help students determine their future fare.

On HeelMeals, users can create an account and log in to see other students’ reviews. They can post their own reviews, which include a title, description, star rating and photo. And once they move on from their dining hall days, users can delete their account.
